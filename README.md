# Big Tuna Helper
A Discord bot written in JavaScript using the Discord.JS library.

### Project Status: ‚úÖ Active

This bot extends the functionality of Huntail's [Big Tuna Discord Bot](https://bigtuna.xyz) by adding various new features, the likes of which are listed below. (Some features were added purely as a gimmick and don't provide any helpful/useful data)<br>
I mainly developed this bot as a way to practice using the Discord.JS library so don't expect the code to be perfect.

## Current Features
- Displays advanced statistics of the current bait being sold in Big Tuna's `.baitshop`, these stats include star rating, recommended price, what percentage of your total Quest Points that bait costs and whether or not that bait is ABOVE or BELOW its recommended price and by how much.<br>

- Displays an estimate of how much your current Bait Inventory is worth in Quest Points (üç≠). (Estimate is taken by multiplying the quantity of each bait by its respective recommended price)<br>

- A simple Bot Statistics command displaying the bot's uptime and satisfied requests. (a glorified way of saying how many embeds it has successfully sent)<br>
